# Data Privacy

KADAI provides authentication and authorization features that are designed to protect the privacy and security of personal data (see [Security and Permissions](../core-concepts/securityAndPermissions.md) and [Security Configuration](../configuration/security.md)). The host of KADAI is responsible for complying with applicable data protection laws and their internal data privacy policies when using KADAI. We strongly recommend keeping the SecurityEnabled flag enabled for any KADAI instance handling sensitive data.
