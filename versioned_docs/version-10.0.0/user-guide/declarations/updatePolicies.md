# Update Policies

KADAI publishes multiple releases each year. There is no specific release cycle.
Our aim is to provide updates in line with the latest stable [Spring Boot releases](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases) to ensure compatibility and keep up to date.

New versions will be announced on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/kadai-io/kadai/releases) page.

## Security Updates

KADAI uses Dependabot with GitHub Actions to automatically obtain security updates from dependencies on a daily basis.
The tool creates pull requests, which we monitor on workdays and merge promptly.

Security vulnerabilities found in KADAI itself are patched as soon as they become known to us.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please contact [kadai@envite.de](mailto:kadai@envite.de) to disclose it.

Non-critical security vulnerabilities can also be reported via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/kadai-io/kadai/issues).

Since the software is open source, security updates can also be integrated at any time via pull requests.
