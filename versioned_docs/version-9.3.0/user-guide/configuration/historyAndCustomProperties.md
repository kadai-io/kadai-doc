# History and Custom Properties

The concept of History in KADAI is explained in more detail [here](../features/kadaiHistorySPI.md). 

## History

- ``kadai.history.deletion.on.task.deletion.enabled``: After deletion of a Task, all history events related to that Task will also be deleted.
- ``` kadai.historylogger.name```: The name of the logger that writes to the audit file.
        Example:
        ``` kadai.historylogger.name=AUDIT ```

## Custom

- ``my_custom_property1`` : You can define the meaning of the value parameter yourself.
- ``my_custom_property2`` : You can define the meaning of the value parameter yourself.
